# PredictingCreditDefault
Develop a predictive model to better classify “at-risk” potential customers.

**Step 1: Perform exploratory data analysis on the titanic data set.**

Multiple packages were used in the notenook. These packages were imported into python 3.5. The packages used are:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

The first two packages are for combutation and data analysis, and the other two packages are for data visulaization.

**Step 2: Build and Evaluate Models to predict the likelihood of credit card default for customers of the Bank**

Based on the understanding and the exploration of the dataset, we will build a supervised machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn

The classification models used for this analysis are: 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree and 
- Random Forest Classifier.

To build machine learning models the original data was divided into features (X) and dependent variable (y) and then split into train (75%) and test (25%) sets. Thus, the algorithms would be trained on one set of data and tested out on a completely different set of data (not seen before by the algorithm).
