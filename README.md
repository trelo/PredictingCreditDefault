# PredictingCreditDefault
Develop a predictive model to better classify “at-risk” potential customers.

**Step 1: Perform exploratory data analysis on the titanic data set.**

Multiple packages were used in the notenook. These packages were imported into python 3.5. The packages used are:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
The first two packages are for combutation and data analysis, and the other two packages are for data visulaization.

Predicting the likelihood of default on loan using scikit learn package will be discussed in future posts.

**Step 2: Build and Evaluate Models to predict the likelihood of credit card default for customers of the Bank**

The classification models used for this analysis are: 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree and 
- Random Forest Classifier.

To build machine learning models the original data was divided into features (X) and dependent variable (y) and then split into train (75%) and test (25%) sets. Thus, the algorithms would be trained on one set of data and tested out on a completely different set of data (not seen before by the algorithm).
